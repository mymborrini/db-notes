Create index takes really a long time and remember (if you are on production) that index lock the full table.
So the insert or the update command will not works.

you can do read But cannot really write.

So postgres create something called concurrency index where you can write and read while the index is created

So instead of doing
- create index  g_idx on grades(g);
type:
- create index concurrently g_idx on grades(g);

Of course this operation, will use more CPU and take much time and moreover can actually fail.
Think of the case of a unique index... if you insert some duplicates all the operation fail.

At this point you have to drop the index and recreate.

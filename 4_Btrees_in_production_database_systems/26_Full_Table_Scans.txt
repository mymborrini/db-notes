Full Table Scan

- To find a row in a large table we perfom full table scan.
- Reading large tables is slow
- Requires many I/Os to read all pages
- We need a way to reduce the "search space"

DBMS are not dump they are smart they split the table working with multithreading but it is
still slow comparing to indexes

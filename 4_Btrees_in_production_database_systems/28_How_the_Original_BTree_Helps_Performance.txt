Let's take an example

Table:

 | TID | ID   | Name
 | 701 | 1    | John
 | 702 | 2    | Ali
 | 703 | 3    | Rick
 | 704 | 4    | Sara
 | 705 | 5    | Edmond

 BTREE:

        | 2:702  | 4:704 |
    ____|        |       |___ 
    |            |          |
  |1:701|     |3:703|     |5:705|   


TID is internal tuple id or ROW ID
In a btree structure key and value exists in all node and this is the reason why
btree will be surpassed by b+tree

So let's try to find ID = 3

1) get the root node (this will have thousends of data)
2) 3 is between 2 and 4 so pull the middle one
3 ) get the 3 node get 703 row id and pull it from the table

So you can search very efficiently

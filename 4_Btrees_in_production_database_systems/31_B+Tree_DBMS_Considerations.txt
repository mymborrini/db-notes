B+Tree & DBMS Considerations
- Cost of leaf pointer (cheap)
- 1 Node fits a DBMS page (most DBMS)
- Can fit internl nodes easily in memory for fast traversal
- Leaf nodes can live in data files in the heap
- Most DBMS use B+tree

Even Mongo DB with wiredTiger database engine, the database engine of Mongo DB is wiredTiger. 
MongoDB use B+Tree index system.

wiredTiger has of course some variants for example leaf node does not have pointer to the following node.
Since in NoSql datbase you usually don't make query for range of ids. They are smart enough not to include
useless stuff.

Of course B+Tree does its  best when putting  in memeory, of courde 
you can also put it on the disk if it's too big, but it could be 
really slow.

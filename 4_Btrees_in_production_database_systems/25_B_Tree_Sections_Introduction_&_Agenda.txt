This subject is really difficult to implements in practice is more like
theoretical knowladge. Since when you analyze the query you're more interested
into the path the query takes to get a particular result

B-Trees vs B+Trees

Problem:
- Full Table Scan -> This is the lowest query possible

Solution:
- B-Tree with its limitations (the limitations of the original B-tree algorithm)
and why its changed into 

- B+Tree, this is the algorithm used in the database right now. The original B-Tree is no 
longer implemented

- B+Tree storage cost in MYSQL(InnoDb default) vs POSTGRES since this issues are related to 
the database engine

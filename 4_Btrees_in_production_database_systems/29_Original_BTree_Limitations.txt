Limitations of BTREE

- Elements in all nodes store both the key and the value
- Internal nodes take more space thus require more IO and can slow down traversal
- Range queries are slow because of random access (give me all values 1-5)
- B+Tree solve these problem

because you store both keys and values you can only store so many elements
So you waste a lot of memory space that you don't use.
If you use a string primary key it will use a lot of space, so nodes will have less elements,
less elements means more nodes, more nodes means more pages, more pages means more IO => slow

Moreover when you add a new elements you have the risk of split and split has a cost.
If you could have nodes with more elements you will split less often so perfomance during insert
could raise.

So internal nodes take more space (2 point).

Another thing is about range queries for example for 1 to 5 if you're unluckly you could have to 
make up to a lot of Btree searching, despite being really compact

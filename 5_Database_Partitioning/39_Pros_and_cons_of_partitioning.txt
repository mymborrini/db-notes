Pros of partitioning:

- Improves query performance when accessing a single partition
- Sequential scan vs scattered index scan 
(this depends on the datbaase and it's plan, it depends of the number of rows returned)
- Easy bulk loading (attach partition)
You can bulk data into a really big table and then attach the partitions
- Archive old data that are barely accessed into cheap storage

The first one is true for really large number of rows, or for partition index with more 
size then an integer like for example a varchar


Cons of partitioning:

- Updates that move row from partition to another could be really slow or fails (sometimes)
- Inefficient query could accidentaly scan all partitions resulting in slow query performance
- Schema changes could be challenging (DBMS could manage it though)

Update could be really slow because you have to do a delete and then a insert.

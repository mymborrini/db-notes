Partitioning vs Sharding

- partition splits big table into multiple tables in the same database, client is agnostic.
- Sharding splits big table into multiple tables across multiple database servers
- partition table name changes, (or schema)
- Sharding everything is the same but servers changes

In partition the client is agnostic, is the database that decides which tables hits based on the where
clause in the query

In Sharding the client is not agnostic he should know which server to connect in order to make query
The client is aware of the shard... this is not something i really like

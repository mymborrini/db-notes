- Horizontal partition split rows into partition:
 - Range or list
- Vertical partition splits columns partitions:
  e.g. Large column (blob) that you barely query. You can store it in a slow access drive
  in its own tablespace

Vertical partition is pretty useful too, so you can save a lot of space

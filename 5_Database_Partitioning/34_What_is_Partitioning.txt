If you have a table with one million rows, scanning all that stuff could be really expensive.

So let's consider a simple table, with id and name, with 1 million rows.
So for example if you have a table for example customers

You can partition like the following

customers 1 million rows => 

customers_200k | customers_400k | customers_600k | customers_800k | customers_1M

Let's split this huge table into 5 smaller tables.

From your point of view, you will always sees and interact with customer table, but the database 
will exactly know which partition to search for

So in both cases (partition or not) you will do the same exactly query:

- select name from customer where id = 700000;

The database will automatically resolve:
Which partition is customer 700000 is?

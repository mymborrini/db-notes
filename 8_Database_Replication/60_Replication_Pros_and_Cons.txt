Pros 
 - Horizontal Scaling
 - Region based queries - DB per Region
Cons
 - Eventual Consistency
 - Slow writes (Synchronous)
 - Complex to implements (multi master)

By Horizontal Scaling in this case means that your reads are scalable, not your writes,
( if you don't implements multi-master of course)

Multi master is like a pain in the ass, so it's better to optimize your write operations as 
much as possible within the master single instance.

Slow writes... it depends how you configure it with First 1, or 2 ecc...

- One Master/Leader node that accepts write/ddls
- One or more backup/standby nodes that receive those writes from the Master
- Simple to implements, no conflicts

The idea is to have a Lead node wich accepts writes and ddl operations, like create
tables ecc... 

Backup/standby node are only read-only nodes, you don't write to your leafs nodes, you only 
writ to your Master node and then the Master node will Replicate your changes on the backup node.

The beatiful of this is that is really easy to implements, and you don't have conflicts since you
only write to the master node.

Exists always a bidirectional TCP connection between the master node and the backup nodes.

Now the main question of course is
DOES THE CLIENTS HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MASTER TO PUSH THE UPDATES TO THE BACKUP NODES?

It depends... this is called Asyncrhonous vs Synchronous updates.

One more thing to understand is that relational databases could be eventual consistency like 
the NOsql databases.

- Synchronous Replication, a write transaction to the master will be blocked until
it is written to the backup nodes

- Asyncrhonous Replication, a write transaction is considered successful if it written to the
master, then Asyncrhonously the writes are applied to the backup nodes.

In Synchronous you have to write to the master and then the children in order to be considered successful,
but if you have 7 children, you have to wait until all the 7th is updated? Postgres can let 
you configure how many children should be updated before the client can be notified
So if it's enough for you to update the first 2 nodes, then the other 5 can be updated Asyncrhonously
and you can tell the client the success after only the first two.

Tls stands for transport layer security

For a long time we have connected clients to databases without encryption, since the databases
are always closed to the outside, so nobody things that someone is goingo to sniff the connection
between the databases and the backend. 
But when tools like kuberneetes enter in the scene, it becames important to encrypt this kind
of connection since our databases is wide open

In order to turn SSL on there are rules specific for each databases
In general you need to things the ssl_cert_file (cert_file.pem), ssl_key_file which is the private
key which unlock the certigicate (private.pem)

So where I get this two file from?
This is where openssl comes in handy

 openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private.pem -out cert.pem
 
 x509 is the type of certificate
 4096 is the security level you need
 nodes is called "no des" and it means no encryption. so postgres can read the 
 certificate file directly. Nginx support this type of file protected, but postgres doesn't

 keyout it means print the private key out and -out print the certificate file out.
 You have to answer a few questions in order to generate the certificate and the private key 
 file.

We have to made the private key accessible, because by default is protected 
 
 chmod 600 private.pem
 chown postgres private.pem


See openSSl_Testfiles folder in order to see the generation of the files.
Now you have to move this files in the directory in the docker image

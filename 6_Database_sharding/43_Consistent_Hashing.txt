Image you have 3 instances of postgres:
- pg1 => 5432
- pg2 => 5433
- pg3 => 5434

In order to make a query consider having the following input
In this case is a string but it could be whatever you want

"Input1" 

So what you have to do is to hash the value, and the result of this hash function will be the instance
of which database instance you have to query. 

hash("Input1") => 5432
hash("Input2") => 5433
hash("Input3") => 5434

As long as you give me Consistent input I'm sure I give you Consistent hashing value

How does it works? For example with 3 instances:

hash("Input2") % 3 => [0,1,2]

Let’s consider having a table of url

| id |  Url  | Url_id |
----------------------
|  1 | http..|  5FTOJ |

Image that this table have billions of data, and querying this table become slower and slower, the more the table increase


So the reason is more or less the same of partition
Split 1 billion rows into 5 (for example) database instances ... same schema

But now consider the following query
- select url, url_id where url_id = “5FTOJ”;

Which database instance have the data you’re looking for

=> Consistent hashing. So you know which database you have to connect, connect make the query and get the result

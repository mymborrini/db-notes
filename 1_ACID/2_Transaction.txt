A transaction is a collection of queries

One unit of work

Eg Account Deposit (SELECT, UPDATE, UPDATE)

Commit and rollback are two concepts attached by transaction

Example:
Account 1 1000$
Account 2 500$

Send 100$ from Account 1 to Account 2

BEGIN TX1
1 ) Check if Account 1 has 100$ -> SELECT BALANCE from Account where id = 1;
2 ) UPDATE Account set BALANCE = BALANCE - 100 where id = 1;
3 ) UPDATE Account set BALANCE = BALANCE + 100 where id = 2;
COMMIT

Phantom reads happens in concurrent transaction
When another transaction insert a row and you should see another rows

tsx1:
 begin transaction;
 select * from sales; (5 rows)
 select pid, sum(price) from sales group by pid; -> 1 | 40 (for example)

tsx2:
 begin transaction;
 insert into sales (pid, price, date) values (1, 15, 'feb-7-2021');
 commit;

tsx1:
 select pid, sum(price) from sales group by pid; -> 1 | 50 (the sum has changed)

So you are getting funky results, this most of the time is undesirable
How can we fix this: isolation level -> serialization
 begin transaction isolation level serializable;

Anything that I read does not depend on other transaction.
And I don't see the row inserted. This is true for every databases, EXCEPT postgres
POSTGRES provides this kind of isolation level even at repeatable read isolation level.

THIS IS VERY SPECIAL FOR POSTGRES, MYSQL IF YOU DID A Repeatable READ ISOLATION WILL NOT protect
YOU FROM Phantom READ;

For all others MYSQL ecc you have to implements serializable isolation level... or some pessimistic lock... 
If someone change this, don't allow me to read it.

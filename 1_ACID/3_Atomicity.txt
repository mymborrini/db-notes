All queries MUST succeed. If one fails all should rollback

Example:
Account 1 1000$
Account 2 500$

Send 100$ from Account 1 to Account 2

BEGIN TX1
1 ) Check if Account 1 has 100$ -> SELECT BALANCE from Account where id = 1;
2 ) UPDATE Account set BALANCE = BALANCE - 100 where id = 1;
3 ) DATABASE crash

If the transaction is not atomic now Account 1 has 100$ less and Account 2 still has the same amount

Exclusive Lock:
 I want to read/write a piece of data (column/row). I want to be sure that nobody is going to read/ 
 write the same piece of data that i'm checking right now for security/consistency ecc... 
 If anybody tries to read thet value he's gonna have an error. 
 I'll be the only one who can update that value, and nobody is gonna read it until I have finished to
 write or I'll be the only one who can read that value, and nobody is gonna update it until I have 
 finished to read.

Shared Lock:
 I want to read a value. And I want to make sure that nobody is gonna update that value. If anybody tries to
 write this value he's gonna have an error. Many connections can acquire different shared lock for 
 the same resources.

When I want to acquire an Exclusive lock, there must be no Shared Lock, and of course 
the opposite is also true, if I want to obtain a Shared Lock there must be non Exclusive lock.

Example:

Alice | $1000
Bob   | $600
Charly| $1200

1. Alice starts a transaction to deposit $200. Obtains Exclusive Lock (SUCCESS).
Nobody acquire any shared lock... so she will succeed
2. transaction committed

Alice | $1200
Bob   | $600
Charly| $1200

3. Alice starts a reporting job on her account, so it starts a long transaction 
She is just doing a read operation, she acquire a shared lock and she succeed.
4. Bob starts a reporting job on his account, he ask for a shared lock and he succeed.
5. Charly wants to do a transfer on Bob account. In this case he attempts to obtain 
an exclusive lock, but since bob got a shared lock before, he FAILS and exits.
6. Bob finish is report and exits
7. Charly attempts again to do the transfer and in this case succeed. In fact right now
Only Alice has a shared lock, but Alice has a shared lock only on her account, so this will not
interfere with Charly activity. Charly acquire the exclusive Lock and succeed and make the transfer.
8. Charly committed $300 from his account to Bob's account.

Alice | $1200
Bob   | $900
Charly| $900

8. Alice completed her reporting and release her shared lock.

Shared Lock and Exclusive lock where introduce to ensure consistency in the system.
Locks are really useful for configuration for Example. Since configuration are generally
centralized.
